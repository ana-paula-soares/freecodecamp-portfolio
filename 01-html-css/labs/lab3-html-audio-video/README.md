## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* HTML5

## 🎯 Objective

The purpose of this lab is to practice integrating multimedia elements into HTML documents, specifically focusing on:

* **Video embedding** (`<video>`) for displaying visual content
* **Audio embedding** (`<audio>`) for playing sound files
* **Media Sources** (`<source>`) or attributes (`src`) to define file paths
* **Media Attributes** (`controls`, `loop`) to manage playback behavior

## 📝 Features

* **Educational Video:** A section displaying a tutorial video about the JavaScript Map Method.
* **Music Player:** An audio section that plays a loopable track ("We Are Going To Make It").
* **User Controls:** Both media players include native controls for play, pause, and volume adjustment.
* **Semantic Structure:** Uses `<section>` tags to distinctively separate the video and audio content areas.
